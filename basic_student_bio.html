    <p>This is a short bio about Kyle. Kyle was born in 
        Santa Monica on a surf board riding the waves next 
        to Santa Monica pier. He has been a surfer dude ever 
        since he came out of the womb. Infact, his mother 
        and father concieved Kyle in the barrel of a 20ft 
        wave at Hunnington Beach. Isn't that wild? No wonder 
        he was born to get tubed! </p>
